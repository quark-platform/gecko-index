The primary reason is that objects that implement\n * this interface generally must be operational *before* XPCOM (or any\n * of the rest of Mozilla) are initialized.  As a result, this\n * interface is instantiated by somewhat unconventional means.\n *\n * To create the implementor of this interface, you call the function\n * NS_CreateNativeAppSupport.  This is done in the startup code\n * in nsAppRunner.cpp\n *\n * The interface provides these functions:\n *  start - You call this to inform the native app support that the\n *          application is starting.  In addition, it serves as a\n *          query as to whether the application should continue to\n *          run.\n *\n *          If the returned boolean result is PR_FALSE, then the\n *          application should exit without further processing.  In\n *          such cases, the returned nsresult indicates whether the\n *          reason to exit is due to an error or not.\n *\n *          Win32 Note: In the case of starting a second instance\n *                      of this executable, this function will return\n *                      PR_FALSE and nsresult==NS_OK.  This means that\n *                      the command line arguments have been\n *                      successfully passed to the instance of the\n *                      application acting as a remote server.\n *  quit - Informs the native app support that the application is stopping. The\n *         app support should disable any functionality enabled by start.\n *\n *  onLastWindowClosing -  Called when the last window is closed. Used as a\n *                         \"soft\" shutdown, passwords are flushed.\n */"
